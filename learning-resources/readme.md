# I strongly advice that you visit 'concepts' before delving into 'dev tools'.

### Navigation
- Select the field you wish to learn (e.g. Software Security).
- Select concepts - videos - youtube, then start with the introductory readme.md file.
- All markdown(md) files are structured. Use the table of content to navigate through sections within the file by clicking.
- Each section has links attached to topics.
